**Procedures for Making Contributions:**

  GrayLog’s very active community is built on being open and accepting of contributions. These contributions can be divided up in several different categories such as documentation, new ideas, code development, Issue identification, and code fixes. It is required that before contributions are made, that the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct is read and understood. This action ensures that the individual preparing to indulge in contributing and thus being an active participant into the Graylog community respects the people and fellow contributors allowing for a welcoming environment. 
  
  For documentation contributions, you are to edit the documentation in the Graylog2 documentation repo and initiate a pull request. To make contributions to the code to add new features, its is identified in their contributor’s guide that the individual should first discuss the idea with the core team. Once this idea is approved, the user should develop this code then file a pull request. This pull request will then be reviewed by the core team before merging code into the project. Additionally, if a issue is identified, they must be reported on the project’s Graylog Server GitHub repo using the issue tracker. It is also highly encurged by the team to attempt to fix reported issues and file a pull request for code to be merged.

**Functional Security Requirements for Graylog:**


**What was Ghostbusters motivation for choosing Graylog?**

Graylog is a powerful extensible open source and diverse log management platform. It is a major competitor to other titans such as the proprietary Solarwinds and Splunk in providing tools for exploiting Big Data analysis, network systems management, forensics, and (dare I say it) Cyber Security! Graylog has a very active multi-contributor community with 533+ commits within the last 12 months from a very diverse population of contributors. No one contributor stands out, and thats a good thing. Furthermore, Graylog is primarily written in Java which affords our team additional leverage as it is the most common language between the four of us. Additionally, its licensing allows for easy access to the code and the ability to freely contribute back to the community as non-regulars. Finally, Graylog also is familiar as its actively being used in the day-to-day operations at the place of employment for one of the team members. All in all, Graylog checks several boxes for open and active development community, GPL license, great guidance on how the community should contribute, great developer documentation, and the wealth of security functional requirements for us to explore.
